Souls are restricting the human body. Remove soul - unlock MAGIC!
Souls occupy bodies to feed on brains, and copy their intellect/information, before going on to the next world.
Souls can only occupy one body per world. (Sequel saved LOL)
End destination and reason for gathering brain power intentionally unknown.

Need a soul remover.. Forcefully removing souls damages the brain. Growing up without a soul causes brain to not develop properly and causes mutations.
1, ALIENS! They eat souls, nom nom. 
2, Something happened in the previous world, souls no longer arrive into this world. 
Would need an explanation of what actually happened, potentially through a soul actually getting through and telling.
3, Aliens/newly arrived thing/power makes soulless existence possible, while before the woman just did not get pregnant from sex if there was no willing soul.
4, Two different kinds of aliens, one which eats souls, another which eats human organs(yoma).
